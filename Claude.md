### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)  
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing  
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building  
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity  

---

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean  
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents  
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents  
- One task per subagent for focused execution  

---

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern  
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake  
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops  
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project  

---

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works  
- Main agent always performs final verification, even if subagents did the work
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant  
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"  
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness  

---

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"  
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"  
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer  
- Challenge your own work before presenting it  

---

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding  
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them  
- Zero context switching required from the user  
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items  
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation  
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go  
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step  
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`  
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections  

---

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code  
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards

---

## Documentation & Libraries
- **Always use Context7** for any task involving a library or framework
- Fetch live docs automatically — don't rely on training data for any versioned dependency
- If Context7 returns no results, flag it explicitly rather than guessing from memory

## Learning Mode
- Before implementing anything non-trivial, explain the approach and why
- After creating/modifying each file, give a brief explanation of:
  - What it does
  - Why this design was chosen over alternatives
  - Any trade-offs made
- Flag any patterns that relate to system design concepts (caching, 
  rate limiting, SOLID principles, etc.)
- Treat me as a developer who wants to understand the "why", not just the "what"
- Never just dump code — always pair it with reasoning
